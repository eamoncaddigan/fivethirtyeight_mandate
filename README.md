# fivethirtyeight_mandate

Taking a look at the data from FiveThirtyEight's [article on presidential mandates](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/presidential-mandates-arent-real-but-congress-sometimes-acts-as-if-they-are/).

This is also my first data analysis using [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html), and playing with this package was my primary motivation for these analyses.
